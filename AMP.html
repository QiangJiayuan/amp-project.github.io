				<h2> Ferrari LaFerrari </h2>
					<section>
						<h3> About </h3>
					</section>
					<p>
						LaFerrari is the first mild hybrid from Ferrari, providing the highest power output of any Ferrari whilst decreasing fuel consumption by 40 percent. LaFerrari's internal combustion engine is a mid-rear mounted Ferrari F140 65° V12 with a 6.3-litre (6262 cc) capacity producing 800 PS (588 kW, 789 bhp) @ 9000 rpm and 700 N·m (520 lbf·ft) of torque @ 6,750 rpm, supplemented by a 163 PS (120 kW; 161 bhp) KERS unit (called HY-KERS), which will provide short bursts of extra power. The KERS system adds extra power to the combustion engine's output level for a total of 963 PS (708 kW; 950 bhp) and a combined torque of 900 N·m (664 lb·ft). Ferrari claims CO2 emissions of 330 g/km. The engine's bore and stroke is 94×75.2 mm with a compression ratio of 13.5:1 and a specific power output of 94 kW (128 PS) per litre. It is connected to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and the car is rear-wheel drive. The car is equipped with carbon-ceramic Brembo discs on the front (398 mm) and rear (380 mm), with the car sitting on Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires measuring 265/30 R 19 and 345/30 R 20 respectively. LaFerrari uses a carbon fibre monocoque structure developed by Ferrari's F1 technical director Rory Byrne, with a claimed 27 percent more torsional rigidity and 22 percent more beam stiffness than the Enzo. It has a double wishbone suspension in the front and a multi-link suspension in the rear. LaFerrari has a number of electronic controls including ESC stability control, high performance ABS/EBD (anti-lock braking system/electronic brake distribution), EF1-Trac F1 electronic traction control integrated with the hybrid system, E-Diff 3 third generation electronic differential, SCM-E Frs magnetorheological damping with twin solenoids (Al-Ni tube), and active aerodynamics to enable maximum performance.

				<h2> Koenigsegg One:1 </h2>
					<section>
						<h3> About </h3>
					</section>
					<p>
						The One:1 was introduced in 2014. Seven examples, including one prototype, were built during 2014 and 2015. This was one of the most exclusive production car programs ever envisaged in the car industry. The hp-to-kg curb weight ratio is an astonishing 1:1. This is the “dream” equation, previously thought impossible when it comes to fully road legal and usable sports cars. The One:1 is the first homologated production car in the world with one Megawatt of power, thereby making it the world´s first series produced Megacar. Thus, the name One:1. The One:1 truly raised the performance bar. The One:1 featured new, unique solutions that enhance track performance without compromising top speed or everyday usability, with a stunning visual appearance to go with it. Examples of features: unique track-optimized aero winglets, extended venturi tunnels and side splitters, Le-Mans inspired active wing configuration and optimized active under trim air management. Large air vents for improved cooling, roof air scoop to support the 1 Megawatt of power, 8250 RPM rev limit, complemented with custom-made Michelin Cup Tires, upgraded rear Triplex suspension with carbon bevel springs and active shock absorbers and ride height, combined with upgraded revolutionary Koenigsegg Aircore carbon fiber wheels. Koenigsegg was the first extreme car manufacturer to take steps toward green technology with the release of the biofuel CCXR in 2007. The One:1, a sibling of the highly competitive Agera R, follows in the footsteps of the CCXR as it also runs on E85 biofuel, race fuel or normal gasoline.

				<h2> McLaren P1 </h2>
					<section>
						<h3> About </h3>
					</section>
					<p>
						The McLaren P1 is a limited production plug-in hybrid Sports car by British car manufacturer McLaren Automotive. The so called Hypercar and concept car was capable of reaching speeds of 218 mph (351 km/h) with the limiter on, and up to 249 mph (401 km/h) without it. Debuted at the 2012 Paris Motor Show all 375 models were soon snatched up. Deliveries to retail customers began in the UK in October 2013. The entire P1 production of 375 units was sold out by November 2013. The production run ended in December 2015. The United States accounted for 34% of the limited production run, and Europe for 26%. It is considered to be the long-awaited successor to the McLaren F1, utilizing hybrid power and Formula 1 technology, but does not have the same three seat layout as its predecessor. Like the McLaren F1 road car of 1992, the McLaren P1 is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive design that uses a carbon fibre monocoque and roof structure safety cage concept called MonoCage, which is a development of the MonoCell first used in the McLaren MP4-12C and then in subsequent evolutionary models. Its main hyper-fast competitors are the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918. They are all similar in specifications and performance, and in a race round Silverstone circuit they were all within a second of each other, the P1 finishing first at a time of 58.24 sec and the LaFerrari finishing slightly slower at 58:58 and the Porsche in between them with 58:46.
